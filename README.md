# Unit 13 Homework: Node Express Handlebars (Burger App)

The purpose of this homework assignment is to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. MVC design pattern will be followed. Handlebars will be used to generate HTML.

Criteria for a successful program:
```
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the     page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* This assignment must be deployed. * Please submit both the deployed Heroku link to your homework AND the link to the Github         Repository!
